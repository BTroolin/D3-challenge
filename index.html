          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Demographic Factors</h2>
          <h3>Healthcare, Poverty and Income:</h3>
          <p>There seems to be a strong correlation between higher rates of poverty and lack of healtchare within populations.
             For example, Mississippi has one fifth of its population both in poverty and without healthcare, while Minnesota
             has roughly one tenth of its people in poverty and lacking healthcare. There seems to be a geographic component as
             well, with states in the American south faring worst in this comparison. A similar trend shows up when looking at 
             healthcare vs income; states with high median incomes tend to have better access to healthcare.
          </p>
          <h3>Obesity vs Income: </h3>
          <p>States with low median incomes also tend to have higher rates of obesity. Southern states again fare worst in this
            comparison with incomes around half of the wealthiest places and nearly double the obesity of the states that fared 
            best. Exactlty how low incomes impact obesity, or vice versa, would be interesting to investigate further. Could it
            be lack of access to healthy food (food deserts)? The impact of lack of healthcare would be another interesting factor
            to examine.
          </p>
          <h3>Age of Population:</h3>
          <p>The median age of a population does not appear to correlate strongly with obesity, smoking or access to healthcare.
             This may be due to the fact that there is not a lot of variation in the median age among states, with the majority
             of states' median age falling within a range of 35 to 40 years old.
